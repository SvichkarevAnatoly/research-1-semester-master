% gul: The Grand Unified BiBTeX Library

% created on Wed, May 21, 2003
% connect.bib was integrated on Sep 8/9, 2003

% contains references from:
% - Yogi's segmentation gene and theory libraries
% - John's original connect.bib without redundancy and with systematic labeling

% remerged with connect.bib july 24, 2006
% duplicate entries resolved in favor of gul.bib style, with
% some irregular exceptions in a-c (then I was consistent). --JR

%++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
% JR, 06/07/2010:
% I just went through this whole file and cleaned it up. Some untidy
% entries were mine, done at the last minute. However, in order for
% this database to be a useful lab resource, you need to know what you
% are doing with this file and treat it like you would laboratory
%  code. In particular, carelessness with the entry of data will
%% result in error-filled bibliographies that have to be edited by
%                  hand.
%Here are some considerations:
% ACCURACY:
% 1. For articles, ALWAYS give volume and page numbers in ASCII (don't
%                  blindly paste). Always give the full page range
%                  unless it is an article number. List an article
%                  number in the 'pages' field, do not use an
%                  'articlenumber' (or whatever) field.
% 2. For articles, NEVER give the month or issue number. If a style
%                  is used that prints these, coverage will be uneven.
% 3. For articles, NEVER use a journal abbreviation. ALWAYS put the
%                  name in full. A paper we publish will get abbrevs in
%                  production. The proper way to do abbrevs is a set of
%                  macros for a particular bst/dtx; they should NOT be
%                  in the database.
% 4. For EVERYTHING, please obey the laboratory first-author-last-name
%                  two digit date convention, with initials to remove
%                  ambiguity. The only exceptions are items with no
%                  author (see Ibm07 for an example). Certain other
%                  special cases have a duplicate entry with the
%                  correct key elsewhere.
% 5. Capitalization in titles. If you want capital letters in titles,
%                  you must use {}, as in {DNA}. If you need a capital
%                  letter in an italicized word, you need extra
%                  brackets or it won't work:  {{\em {{D}rosophila}}.
% TIDYNESS:
% 1. Indentation: Like computer code, indentation improves
%                  readability. I use emacs bibtex-fill-mode, but there
%                  are other ways. I do not insist on a fixed
%                  indentation style, but PLEASE keep lines to 80-90
%                  bytes, make sure fields are indented relative to
%                  entries (records), and make sure line breaks in
%                  fields are indented relative to the field
%                  indentifier ('author', 'title', etc.).

%         Mondo Thanks!!! --JR

% gul: The Grand Unified BiBTeX Library

% created on Wed, May 21, 2003
% connect.bib was integrated on Sep 8/9, 2003

% contains references from:
% - Yogi's segmentation gene and theory libraries
% - John's original connect.bib without redundancy and with systematic labeling

% remerged with connect.bib july 24, 2006
% duplicate entries resolved in favor of gul.bib style, with
% some irregular exceptions in a-c (then I was consistent). --JR
%+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++=
% Warning!! Make sure you understand how to use bibtex and how
% lab keys work before modifying this file, particulrly when to
% use {{ }}. please indent properly, also. JR, Fall 2009
%++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
% JR, 06/07/2010:
% I just went through this whole file and cleaned it up. Some untidy
% entries were mine, done at the last minute. However, in order for
% this database to be a useful lab resource, you need to know what you
% are doing with this file and treat it like you would laboratory
%  code. In particular, carelessness with the entry of data will
%% result in error-filled bibliographies that have to be edited by
%                  hand.
%Here are some considerations:
% ACCURACY:
% 1. For articles, ALWAYS give volume and page numbers in ASCII (don't
%                  blindly paste). Always give the full page range
%                  unless it is an article number. List an article
%                  number in the 'pages' field, do not use an
%                  'articlenumber' (or whatever) field.
% 2. For articles, NEVER give the month or issue number. If a style
%                  is used that prints these, coverage will be uneven.
% 3. For articles, NEVER use a journal abbreviation. ALWAYS put the
%                  name in full. A paper we publish will get abbrevs in
%                  production. The proper way to do abbrevs is a set of
%                  macros for a particular bst/dtx; they should NOT be
%                  in the database.
% 4. For EVERYTHING, please obey the laboratory first-author-last-name
%                  two digit date convention, with initials to remove
%                  ambiguity. The only exceptions are items with no
%                  author (see Ibm07 for an example). Certain other
%                  special cases have a duplicate entry with the
%                  correct key elsewhere.
% 5. Capitalization in titles. If you want capital letters in titles,
%                  you must use {}, as in {DNA}. If you need a capital
%                  letter in an italicized word, you need extra
%                  brackets or it won't work:  {{\em {{D}rosophila}}.
% TIDYNESS:
% 1. Indentation: Like computer code, indentation improves
%                  readability. I use emacs bibtex-fill-mode, but there
%                  are other ways. I do not insist on a fixed
%                  indentation style, but PLEASE keep lines to 80-90
%                  bytes, make sure fields are indented relative to
%                  entries (records), and make sure line breaks in
%                  fields are indented relative to the field
%                  indentifier ('author', 'title', etc.).
%
%         Mondo Thanks!!! --JR
